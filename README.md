# Gender of French nouns

Like other Romance languages, French nouns are divided in two almost distinct genders: feminine and masculine. Deciding the gender of a word is not obvious. For example, a table is feminine (“une table”) but an acid is masculine (“un acide”).

The code loads a dictionary and represents with bar plots the distribution of the gender across the letters.
